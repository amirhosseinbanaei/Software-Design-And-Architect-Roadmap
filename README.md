## âœ… Phase 1: Deep Software Design with TypeScript

- [ ] Master SOLID principles and apply them in small components
- [ ] Refactor a medium project using clean software design practices
- [ ] Learn and implement 10+ core design patterns (Factory, Observer, etc.)
- [ ] Build a reusable form or component library using functional programming principles
- [ ] Practice dependency injection and inversion of control

---

## âœ… Phase 2: Software Architecture with TypeScript + NestJS

- [ ] Study Clean Architecture, Onion Architecture, and Hexagonal Architecture
- [ ] Implement Clean Architecture in a new NestJS project
- [ ] Understand and apply Domain-Driven Design (Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates)
- [ ] Split a monolith into logical modules and layers
- [ ] Document and diagram your application architecture

---

## âœ… Phase 3: Concurrency & Clean Backend with Go

- [ ] Learn Go syntax and idiomatic programming
- [ ] Use Goroutines and Channels to build concurrent applications
- [ ] Design a Clean Architecture service in Go (e.g. payment service)
- [ ] Implement GRPC microservices with Protocol Buffers
- [ ] Build observability into services (logs, metrics, tracing)

---

## âœ… Phase 4: System Design Fundamentals

- [ ] Study system design topics: load balancing, caching, queues, sharding
- [ ] Design a scalable architecture for a real-world app (e.g. Twitter, Instagram)
- [ ] Compare NoSQL and SQL database scaling techniques
- [ ] Read and analyze top system design interview solutions
- [ ] Simulate scaling bottlenecks and propose solutions

---

## âœ… Phase 5: Low-Level Concepts with C

- [ ] Understand memory management and pointer basics
- [ ] Write C code for stack/heap data structures
- [ ] Implement manual file I/O and buffer handling
- [ ] Relate C concepts to high-level abstractions in Go and TypeScript

---

## âœ… Phase 6: Final Real-World System Project

- [ ] Rebuild a complex full-stack system (e.g. Menubar) using best practices
- [ ] Use NestJS for APIs, Go for microservices, Redis for caching, PostgreSQL for DB
- [ ] Implement a queue system (e.g. order processing)
- [ ] Add monitoring/logging and write deployment docs
- [ ] Create a full architectural diagram and present it like a system designer

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Tech Stack

- Languages: TypeScript, Go, C
- Backend: NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis, GRPC
- Infrastructure: Docker, Message Queues, Monitoring tools
- Design Patterns, Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, System Design concepts
